# AdvancedFarming
A fun Forge Mod that I'm making that involves incubators, farming, photosynthesis, and NPK fertilizers

I have closely followed McJty's tutorials on ForgeModding and had a go at building something very similar but also completely different.

## Features and current ideas
- [x] Power biogenerator using wood as fuel
- [ ] Functional base station

- [ ] Crop/plant baked model
- [ ] NPK Fertilizers uses and production
- [ ] Light controls
- [ ] Temperature controls
- [ ] Humidity controls
- [ ] CO2 Controls
